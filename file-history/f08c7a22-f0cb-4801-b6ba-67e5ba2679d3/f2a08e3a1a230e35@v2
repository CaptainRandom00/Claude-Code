# Specification Quality Checklist: Widget-Based Dashboard Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Summary**:
- 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found
- 35 functional requirements defined (FR-001 to FR-035)
- 17 success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 to SC-017)
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1 to P4) with independent test criteria
- 9 edge cases documented
- 8 assumptions explicitly stated
- 0 implementation details leaked into specification

**Readiness**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

All validation criteria passed. Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning phase.
