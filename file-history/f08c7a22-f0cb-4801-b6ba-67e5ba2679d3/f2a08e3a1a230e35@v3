# Specification Quality Checklist: Widget-Based Dashboard Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met (Updated after gap resolution)

**Summary**:
- 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found
- 61 functional requirements defined (FR-001 to FR-061)
  - FR-001 to FR-035: Core functionality ✅
  - FR-036 to FR-040: Security requirements ✅ (Added)
  - FR-041 to FR-045: Accessibility requirements ✅ (Added)
  - FR-046 to FR-050: Error recovery & resilience ✅ (Added)
  - FR-051 to FR-053: Network & offline behavior ✅ (Added)
  - FR-054 to FR-056: UI states & empty data ✅ (Added)
  - FR-057 to FR-061: Resource limits & performance constraints ✅ (Added)
- 17 success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 to SC-017)
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1 to P4) with independent test criteria
- 9 edge cases documented (1 updated for storage clarity)
- 8 assumptions explicitly stated (1 updated for storage strategy clarity)
- 0 implementation details leaked into specification

**Key Improvements Made** (2025-10-11):
- ✅ Added comprehensive security requirements (XSS, CSRF, input validation, SQL injection prevention)
- ✅ Added WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance requirements
- ✅ Added error recovery mechanisms (autosave, session expiry, crash recovery, version history)
- ✅ Added network/offline behavior handling
- ✅ Added empty state and zero-data requirements
- ✅ Added resource consumption limits (memory, CPU, bandwidth, throttling)
- ✅ Quantified ambiguous terms (widget dimensions: 2x2 to 12x8 grid cells)
- ✅ Quantified preview latency (500ms threshold)
- ✅ Clarified storage strategy (server-side primary with browser caching)

**Readiness**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

All validation criteria passed. Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning phase.
