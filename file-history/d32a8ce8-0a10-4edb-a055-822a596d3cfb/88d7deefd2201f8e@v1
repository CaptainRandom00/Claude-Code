2. **Given** an enterprise client wants to verify industry expertise, **When** they navigate to the industries section, **Then** they should see industry-specific compliance certifications and relevant case studies

3. **Given** a visitor wants to contact Byte Bridges, **When** they fill out the contact form, **Then** they should receive confirmation of submission and expected response time

4. **Given** an IT decision maker wants to evaluate technical capabilities, **When** they view the technology stack section, **Then** they should see comprehensive listings of technologies and expertise levels

5. **Given** a user searches for specific content, **When** they use the search functionality, **Then** they should receive relevant results from services, industries, case studies, and blog posts
