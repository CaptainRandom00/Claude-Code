## 🔄 **Daily Workflow Patterns**

### **Morning Project Planning**
```
1. Review active projects: "What's the status of [project name]?"
2. Prioritize daily tasks: "What should we focus on today?"
3. Address blockers: Let stuck agent escalate decisions from yesterday
4. Plan new work: Route new requirements to appropriate agents
```

### **During Development**
```
1. Monitor agent progress: Agents report completion with documentation
2. Make decisions: Answer stuck agent questions promptly
3. Review constitutional compliance: Ensure quality standards maintained
4. Coordinate integration: Use tech-lead for complex multi-agent work
```

### **End-of-Day Review**
```
1. Check completion status: "Summarize today's progress"
2. Plan tomorrow: "What are the next priorities?"
3. Review audit trails: Ensure documentation is complete
4. Address any stuck agents: Resolve pending questions
```

## 🎛️ **Advanced Operation Techniques**

### **Multi-Agent Coordination**
When projects require multiple specialists:

```
"Build a complete e-commerce solution"
Use: "tech-lead, coordinate building an e-commerce platform with:"
- User authentication and profiles
- Product catalog and search
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Payment processing integration
- Admin management interface
- Performance optimization
- Security audit and testing
```

**Expected**: tech-lead coordinates sequential and parallel work across all relevant agents.

### **Constitutional Compliance Override**
When business requirements conflict with constitutional principles:

```
Example: "We need this feature by tomorrow, skip the tests"
Expected: stuck agent escalates with options:
A) Maintain Test-First principle (delays delivery)
B) Deliver with post-implementation testing (violates constitution)
C) Implement minimal viable tests now, comprehensive later

You decide based on business priorities.
```

### **Complex Integration Projects**
For BB Management System or enterprise clients:

```
"Integrate with client's existing CRM system"
Use tech-lead for coordination:
- api-architect: Integration API design
- security-auditor: External system security
- python-backend: Integration implementation
- qa-engineer: Integration testing
- devops-web: Secure deployment
```

## 🎯 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Problem**: Claude implements directly instead of routing
**Solution**: Use orchestration language:
- ❌ "Build a login form"
- ✅ "I need a login form built" or "Route this to the appropriate specialist"

### **Problem**: Too many questions from stuck agent
**Solution**: Provide more detailed initial requirements:
- ❌ "Make the website faster"
- ✅ "Optimize website loading speed to under 2 seconds on mobile"

### **Problem**: Agents working on conflicting solutions
**Solution**: Use tech-lead for coordination:
- "tech-lead, coordinate the authentication implementation across frontend and backend"

### **Problem**: Quality gates blocking delivery
**Solution**: Use stuck agent to escalate business vs quality decisions:
- ❌ Override agents directly
- ✅ Let stuck agent present options for business decision

## 📋 **Constitutional Compliance Guide**

### **Byte Bridges Core Principles**
Your agents automatically enforce these principles:

#### **1. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- **What it means**: Tests written and failing before any implementation
- **When it applies**: All code development, API endpoints, UI components
- **Agent responsible**: qa-engineer enforces, all agents comply
- **Override process**: Must be escalated through stuck agent

#### **2. Security by Design**
- **What it means**: Security considerations built into every component
- **When it applies**: All user inputs, data storage, API endpoints
- **Agent responsible**: security-auditor reviews, all agents implement
- **Compliance check**: Mandatory for client-facing systems

#### **3. Performance Standards**
- **What it means**: Response times under 200ms, optimized loading
- **When it applies**: All web interfaces, API endpoints
- **Agent responsible**: frontend-perf monitors, all agents optimize
- **Measurement**: Automated testing validates performance

#### **4. Simplicity**
- **What it means**: Clear, maintainable solutions over complexity
- **When it applies**: Architecture decisions, code structure
- **Agent responsible**: chief-architect enforces, all agents follow
- **Trade-offs**: Escalated when simplicity conflicts with requirements

#### **5. Documentation Standards**
- **What it means**: Comprehensive audit trails and documentation
- **When it applies**: All decisions, implementations, integrations
- **Agent responsible**: All agents document, tech-lead coordinates
- **Quality**: Must be sufficient for handoff and maintenance

## 🔍 **Working with the Stuck Agent**

### **When Stuck Agent Activates**
The stuck agent escalates when:
- Multiple valid technical approaches exist
- Business requirements conflict with constitutional principles
- Resource or timeline constraints affect quality
- Client requirements are ambiguous or conflicting
- Security implications need business decision

### **How to Respond to Stuck Agent**
1. **Read the full context** provided
2. **Consider the options** presented with pros/cons
3. **Think about business impact** and client needs
4. **Make a clear decision** from the options or provide alternative
5. **Specify constraints** for implementation

### **Example Stuck Agent Interaction**
```
🚨 ESCALATION: react-expert Problem

Context: Building client dashboard for BB Management System

Problem: State management architecture decision
Options:
A) React Context (simple, performance concerns with real-time data)
B) Redux Toolkit (powerful, adds complexity and learning curve)
C) Zustand (lightweight, less ecosystem support)

Constitutional Impact: Simplicity vs Performance Standards
Client Impact: Real-time inventory updates vs development timeline
Recommendation: Option B for long-term scalability

Your decision?
```

**Good Response**:
"Option B - Use Redux Toolkit. The BB Management System needs to scale and handle real-time data effectively. The complexity is justified for this business-critical system. Ensure documentation is comprehensive for team knowledge transfer."

## 📊 **Quality Assurance & Validation**

### **Automated Quality Gates**
Your system automatically enforces:
- ✅ **Test-first development**: No implementation without failing tests
- ✅ **Performance validation**: All APIs under 200ms response
- ✅ **Security review**: Mandatory for client-facing systems
- ✅ **Visual testing**: Playwright screenshots for UI components
- ✅ **Constitutional compliance**: All principles checked

### **Human Quality Gates**
You control these decision points:
- **Architecture complexity**: Simple vs powerful solutions
- **Feature scope**: Business requirements vs timeline
- **Security vs usability**: Convenience vs protection trade-offs
- **Performance vs features**: Speed vs functionality balance
- **Client customization**: Standard vs bespoke solutions

### **Audit Trail Verification**
Each agent provides:
- **Task documentation**: What was requested and when
- **Analysis summary**: How the problem was approached
- **Implementation details**: What was built and how
- **Testing evidence**: Proof that quality gates passed
- **Integration notes**: How it connects with other components
