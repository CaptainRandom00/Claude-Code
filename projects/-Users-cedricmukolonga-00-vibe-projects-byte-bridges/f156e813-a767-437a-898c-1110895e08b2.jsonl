If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: $ARGUMENTS\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"43d39a5c-f83c-4946-a26b-6c42afa8c607","timestamp":"2025-11-07T20:13:40.245Z"}

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):\n   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory\n   - For each checklist, count:\n     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`\n     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`\n   - Create a status table:\n\n     ```text\n     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |\n     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|\n     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |\n     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |\n     ```\n\n   - Calculate overall status:\n     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items\n     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items\n\n   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:\n     - Display the table with incomplete item counts\n     - **STOP** and ask: \"Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)\"\n     - Wait for user response before continuing\n     - If user says \"no\" or \"wait\" or \"stop\", halt execution\n     - If user says \"yes\" or \"proceed\" or \"continue\", proceed to step 3\n\n   - **If all checklists are complete**:\n     - Display the table showing all checklists passed\n     - Automatically proceed to step 3\n\n3. Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc*or eslint.config.* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"f5df5fe2-08f9-4acb-93bb-b0ad40b4202f","timestamp":"2025-11-07T20:56:36.479Z"}

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the technical context have been resolved through research and established patterns.\n\n## 1. Framework Selection: Next.js 14 with App Router\n\n### Decision\nUse Next.js 14.1.0 with the App Router (not Pages Router)\n\n### Rationale\n- **Server Components by default**: Better performance, smaller bundle sizes\n- **Streaming SSR**: Improved perceived performance with Suspense\n- **Route handlers**: Clean API routes replacing old API pages\n- **Layout system**: Better code reuse and nested layouts\n- **Metadata API**: Built-in SEO optimization\n- **Already in use**: Project dependencies show Next.js 14.1.0 installed\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n- **Pages Router**: Older, more documented, but missing modern features\n- **Remix**: Great DX but smaller ecosystem, steeper learning curve\n- **Astro**: Excellent for static sites but less suitable for admin panel needs\n- **Pure React + Express**: More control but requires more boilerplate\n\n### Implementation Notes\n```typescript\n// Example App Router structure\napp/\n├── (public)/          // Route group for public pages\n│   ├── layout.tsx     // Public layout\n│   └── page.tsx       // Homepage\n├── (admin)/           // Route group for admin\n│   ├── layout.tsx     // Admin layout with auth\n│   └── dashboard/\n└── api/               // Route handlers\n    └── blog/\n        └── route.ts   // API endpoint\n```\n\n## 2. Authentication: NextAuth v4\n\n### Decision\nUse NextAuth v4 with Credentials provider for admin authentication\n\n### Rationale\n- **Industry standard**: Most popular auth solution for Next.js\n- **Session management**: Built-in JWT or database sessions\n- **Middleware integration**: Easy route protection\n- **Type-safe**: Excellent TypeScript support\n- **Already installed**: Package.json shows next-auth@^4.24.0\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n- **Clerk**: Fully managed but overkill for simple admin auth\n- **Auth0**: Enterprise-grade but unnecessary for this use case\n- **Custom JWT solution**: More control but reinventing the wheel\n- **Supabase Auth**: Good but introduces another service dependency\n\n### Implementation Notes\n```typescript\n// lib/auth/config.ts\nimport NextAuth from \"next-auth\"\nimport CredentialsProvider from \"next-auth/providers/credentials\"\nimport { compare } from \"bcryptjs\"\nimport { query } from \"@/lib/db\"\n\nexport const authOptions = {\n  providers: [\n    CredentialsProvider({\n      credentials: {\n        email: { type: \"email\" },\n        password: { type: \"password\" }\n      },\n      async authorize(credentials) {\n        const user = await query(\n          'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1',\n          [credentials.email]\n        )\n        if (user && await compare(credentials.password, user.password_hash)) {\n          return { id: user.id, email: user.email }\n        }\n        return null\n      }\n    })\n  ],\n  session: { strategy: \"jwt\" },\n  pages: {\n    signIn: \"/signin\",\n    error: \"/auth/error\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Security Considerations\n- Password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor: 12)\n- HTTPS only in production\n- CSRF protection via NextAuth\n- Rate limiting on signin endpoint\n- Session timeout: 7 days\n\n## 3. Database: PostgreSQL with pg Driver\n\n### Decision\nPostgreSQL 14+ with node-postgres (pg) client library\n\n### Rationale\n- **Relational model**: Blog posts, case studies have clear relationships\n- **Full-text search**: Built-in `tsvector` for content search\n- **JSON support**: Flexible for tags, metadata\n- **ACID compliance**: Data integrity for content management\n- **Already configured**: db.ts exists, package.json has pg@^8.11.3\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n- **Prisma ORM**: Better DX but adds complexity, migration overhead\n- **Drizzle ORM**: Lightweight but less mature ecosystem\n- **MongoDB**: Good for flexibility but overkill for structured content\n- **SQLite**: Simple but lacks full-text search, not production-ready\n\n### Schema Design Principles\n```sql\n-- Normalized structure\n-- Use SERIAL or UUID for IDs\n-- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at (UTC)\n-- Soft deletes: deleted_at (nullable)\n-- Indexes on foreign keys and search fields\n-- Text search indexes for content\n\nCREATE TABLE blog_posts (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,\n  content TEXT NOT NULL,\n  author_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),\n  category VARCHAR(100),\n  tags TEXT[],\n  published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,\n  published_at TIMESTAMP,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  search_vector tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (\n    to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content)\n  ) STORED\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_blog_posts_search ON blog_posts USING GIN(search_vector);\nCREATE INDEX idx_blog_posts_published ON blog_posts(published, published_at DESC);\n```\n\n### Connection Pooling\n```typescript\n// lib/db.ts\nimport { Pool } from 'pg'\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\n  max: 20,                 // Maximum pool size\n  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // Close idle connections after 30s\n  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000\n})\n\nexport async function query(text: string, params?: any[]) {\n  const start = Date.now()\n  const res = await pool.query(text, params)\n  const duration = Date.now() - start\n  console.log('Executed query', { text, duration, rows: res.rowCount })\n  return res.rows\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Styling: TailwindCSS with WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance\n\n### Decision\nTailwindCSS 3.4+ with custom accessibility-focused configuration\n\n### Rationale\n- **Utility-first**: Rapid development, consistent spacing/colors\n- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first breakpoints out of the box\n- **Accessibility**: Built-in focus rings, screen reader utilities\n- **Performance**: Purges unused styles in production\n- **Already integrated**: tailwind.config.ts exists\n\n### WCAG 2.1 Level AA Requirements\n```typescript\n// tailwind.config.ts\nexport default {\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        // All color combinations must meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio\n        primary: {\n          50: '#f0f9ff',\n          100: '#e0f2fe',\n          200: '#bae6fd',\n          // ... ensure AA contrast\n          600: '#0284c7', // Primary CTA - 4.52:1 on white\n          700: '#0369a1',\n          900: '#0c4a6e'\n        }\n      },\n      fontSize: {\n        // Minimum 16px for body text\n        base: ['16px', { lineHeight: '1.5' }],\n        lg: ['18px', { lineHeight: '1.6' }],\n        // Heading scale with proper contrast\n      },\n      spacing: {\n        // Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n        'touch': '44px'\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),        // Accessible form styles\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),   // Prose content styling\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Accessibility Checklist\n- ✅ Color contrast 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text\n- ✅ Focus indicators visible (outline-2 outline-offset-2)\n- ✅ Touch targets 44x44px minimum\n- ✅ Semantic HTML (headings, landmarks, lists)\n- ✅ ARIA labels where needed\n- ✅ Keyboard navigation support\n- ✅ Screen reader testing with VoiceOver/NVDA\n\n### Animation Guidelines\n```typescript\n// Respect prefers-reduced-motion\n// framer-motion config\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\n\nconst variants = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.4,\n      ease: 'easeOut'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Use motion.div with variants\n<motion.div\n  variants={variants}\n  initial=\"hidden\"\n  animate=\"visible\"\n  // Respects prefers-reduced-motion automatically\n/>\n```\n\n## 5. Forms: React Hook Form + Zod Validation\n\n### Decision\nReact Hook Form 7+ with Zod schema validation\n\n### Rationale\n- **Type safety**: Zod schemas generate TypeScript types\n- **Performance**: Uncontrolled inputs, minimal re-renders\n- **Validation**: Client-side + server-side with same schemas\n- **Multi-step forms**: Built-in support for complex flows\n- **Already installed**: Both libraries in package.json\n\n### Multi-Step Contact Form Pattern\n```typescript\n// lib/validation.ts\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nexport const contactFormSchema = z.object({\n  // Step 1: Basic Info\n  name: z.string().min(2, \"Name required\"),\n  email: z.string().email(\"Valid email required\"),\n  company: z.string().optional(),\n\n  // Step 2: Project Details\n  serviceInterest: z.enum([\n    'custom-software',\n    'web-development',\n    'mobile-apps',\n    'cloud-solutions',\n    'ai-integration',\n    'consulting'\n  ]),\n  budgetRange: z.enum(['<50k', '50k-100k', '100k-250k', '250k+']),\n  timeline: z.enum(['urgent', '1-3-months', '3-6-months', '6+ months']),\n\n  // Step 3: Message\n  projectDetails: z.string().min(50, \"Please provide more details\"),\n\n  // Privacy\n  gdprConsent: z.boolean().refine(val => val === true, {\n    message: \"You must accept the privacy policy\"\n  })\n})\n\nexport type ContactFormData = z.infer<typeof contactFormSchema>\n```\n\n### Server-Side Validation\n```typescript\n// app/api/contact/route.ts\nimport { contactFormSchema } from '@/lib/validation'\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const body = await req.json()\n\n  // Validate with Zod\n  const result = contactFormSchema.safeParse(body)\n\n  if (!result.success) {\n    return Response.json({\n      error: 'Validation failed',\n      details: result.error.flatten()\n    }, { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Process valid data\n  const data = result.data\n  // ... save to database, send email\n}\n```\n\n## 6. Testing Strategy: Playwright E2E + Visual Regression\n\n### Decision\nPlaywright for end-to-end and visual regression testing\n\n### Rationale\n- **Cross-browser**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit support\n- **Accessibility testing**: Built-in ARIA/role assertions\n- **Visual regression**: Screenshot comparison\n- **Fast execution**: Parallel test runner\n- **Already configured**: playwright.config.ts exists\n\n### Test Pyramid\n```\n         /\\\n        /  \\       E2E Tests (Playwright)\n       /____\\      - Critical user flows\n      /      \\     - Cross-browser compatibility\n     /        \\\n    /__________\\   Visual Regression (Playwright)\n   /            \\  - Component snapshots\n  /              \\ - Layout consistency\n /________________\\\nIntegration Tests     Unit Tests\n- API endpoints       - Utility functions\n- Database ops        - Validation schemas\n- Email sending       - Pure logic\n```\n\n### Critical Test Scenarios\n```typescript\n// tests/e2e/contact.spec.ts\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'\n\ntest.describe('Contact Form', () => {\n  test('should complete multi-step form submission', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/contact')\n\n    // Step 1: Basic Info\n    await page.fill('input[name=\"name\"]', 'John Doe')\n    await page.fill('input[name=\"email\"]', 'john@example.com')\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Next\")')\n\n    // Step 2: Project Details\n    await page.selectOption('select[name=\"serviceInterest\"]', 'web-development')\n    await page.selectOption('select[name=\"budgetRange\"]', '50k-100k')\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Next\")')\n\n    // Step 3: Message\n    await page.fill('textarea[name=\"projectDetails\"]', 'Need a new website...')\n    await page.check('input[name=\"gdprConsent\"]')\n\n    // Submit\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Submit\")')\n\n    // Verify success\n    await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toBeVisible()\n    await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toContainText(\n      'We will contact you within 24 hours'\n    )\n  })\n\n  test('should validate required fields', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/contact')\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Next\")')\n\n    // Check validation errors\n    await expect(page.locator('text=Name required')).toBeVisible()\n    await expect(page.locator('text=Valid email required')).toBeVisible()\n  })\n\n  test('should be accessible', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/contact')\n\n    // Check ARIA labels\n    await expect(page.locator('form')).toHaveAttribute('aria-label')\n\n    // Check keyboard navigation\n    await page.keyboard.press('Tab')\n    const focused = page.locator(':focus')\n    await expect(focused).toHaveAttribute('name', 'name')\n\n    // Check focus indicators\n    const outline = await focused.evaluate(el =>\n      window.getComputedStyle(el).outlineWidth\n    )\n    expect(parseInt(outline)).toBeGreaterThan(0)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### Visual Regression Setup\n```typescript\n// tests/visual/visual-regression.spec.ts\ntest('Homepage visual consistency', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/')\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')\n\n  // Full page screenshot\n  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('homepage.png', {\n    fullPage: true,\n    animations: 'disabled'\n  })\n\n  // Component screenshot\n  const hero = page.locator('.hero-section')\n  await expect(hero).toHaveScreenshot('hero-section.png')\n})\n```\n\n## 7. Google Analytics Integration (GDPR Compliant)\n\n### Decision\nGoogle Analytics 4 with consent management and cookie banner\n\n### Rationale\n- **Industry standard**: Most widely used analytics platform\n- **GDPR compliance**: Can be configured for ICO requirements\n- **Event tracking**: Custom events for conversions\n- **Next.js integration**: Use next/script for optimal loading\n- **Requirement**: Specified in FR-014\n\n### Implementation Pattern\n```typescript\n// components/GoogleAnalytics.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport function GoogleAnalytics({ measurementId }: { measurementId: string }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Check consent before initializing\n    const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')\n    if (consent === 'accepted') {\n      // @ts-ignore\n      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []\n      function gtag(...args: any[]) {\n        // @ts-ignore\n        window.dataLayer.push(arguments)\n      }\n      gtag('js', new Date())\n      gtag('config', measurementId, {\n        anonymize_ip: true,  // GDPR requirement\n        cookie_flags: 'SameSite=None;Secure'\n      })\n    }\n  }, [measurementId])\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${measurementId}`}\n        strategy=\"afterInteractive\"\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Consent Management\n```typescript\n// components/CookieBanner.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport function CookieBanner() {\n  const [showBanner, setShowBanner] = useState(false)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')\n    if (!consent) setShowBanner(true)\n  }, [])\n\n  const acceptCookies = () => {\n    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'accepted')\n    setShowBanner(false)\n    window.location.reload() // Reload to initialize GA\n  }\n\n  const declineCookies = () => {\n    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'declined')\n    setShowBanner(false)\n  }\n\n  if (!showBanner) return null\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 z-50\">\n      <div className=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto flex items-center justify-between\">\n        <p>\n          We use cookies to improve your experience and analyze site traffic.\n          <a href=\"/privacy\" className=\"underline ml-2\">Learn more</a>\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <button onClick={declineCookies} className=\"px-4 py-2\">\n            Decline\n          </button>\n          <button\n            onClick={acceptCookies}\n            className=\"px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 rounded\"\n          >\n            Accept\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Event Tracking\n```typescript\n// lib/analytics.ts\nexport function trackEvent(action: string, category: string, label?: string, value?: number) {\n  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {\n    window.gtag('event', action, {\n      event_category: category,\n      event_label: label,\n      value: value\n    })\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage in components\ntrackEvent('contact_form_submit', 'engagement', 'header_cta')\ntrackEvent('case_study_view', 'content', 'healthcare-platform', 1)\n```\n\n## 8. Email Service: Nodemailer with SMTP\n\n### Decision\nNodemailer with configurable SMTP (supports Gmail, SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)\n\n### Rationale\n- **Flexible**: Works with any SMTP provider\n- **Template support**: Can use HTML templates\n- **Attachments**: Support for file attachments (future)\n- **Already installed**: nodemailer@^6.9.0 in package.json\n- **Requirement**: FR-006 specifies email notifications\n\n### Configuration\n```typescript\n// lib/email.ts\nimport nodemailer from 'nodemailer'\n\nconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({\n  host: process.env.EMAIL_HOST,       // smtp.gmail.com\n  port: parseInt(process.env.EMAIL_PORT || '587'),\n  secure: false,                      // true for 465, false for other ports\n  auth: {\n    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,\n    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD  // App password for Gmail\n  }\n})\n\nexport async function sendContactNotification(data: ContactFormData) {\n  const html = `\n    <h2>New Contact Form Submission</h2>\n    <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${data.name}</p>\n    <p><strong>Email:</strong> ${data.email}</p>\n    <p><strong>Company:</strong> ${data.company || 'N/A'}</p>\n    <p><strong>Service Interest:</strong> ${data.serviceInterest}</p>\n    <p><strong>Budget Range:</strong> ${data.budgetRange}</p>\n    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> ${data.timeline}</p>\n    <h3>Project Details:</h3>\n    <p>${data.projectDetails}</p>\n  `\n\n  await transporter.sendMail({\n    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,\n    to: process.env.CONTACT_EMAIL,    // Single admin email (FR-006)\n    subject: `New Contact: ${data.serviceInterest} - ${data.company || data.name}`,\n    html\n  })\n}\n\nexport async function sendConfirmationEmail(to: string, name: string) {\n  await transporter.sendMail({\n    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,\n    to,\n    subject: 'Thank you for contacting Byte Bridges',\n    html: `\n      <h2>Hi ${name},</h2>\n      <p>Thank you for your interest in Byte Bridges. We have received your inquiry and will respond within 24 hours.</p>\n      <p>Best regards,<br/>The Byte Bridges Team</p>\n    `\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n```env\n# .env.local\nEMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com\nEMAIL_PORT=587\nEMAIL_USER=notifications@bytebridges.com\nEMAIL_PASSWORD=app_specific_password\nEMAIL_FROM=Byte Bridges <noreply@bytebridges.com>\nCONTACT_EMAIL=info@bytebridges.com\n```\n\n## 9. Performance Optimization\n\n### Decision\nImplement comprehensive performance optimization strategy\n\n### Key Techniques\n\n#### Image Optimization\n```typescript\n// Use Next.js Image component\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n<Image\n  src=\"/images/hero.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Byte Bridges team\"\n  width={1200}\n  height={600}\n  priority  // For above-the-fold images\n  placeholder=\"blur\"\n  blurDataURL=\"data:image/...\"\n/>\n```\n\n#### Code Splitting\n```typescript\n// Dynamic imports for heavy components\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst AdminDashboard = dynamic(() => import('@/components/admin/Dashboard'), {\n  loading: () => <LoadingSpinner />,\n  ssr: false  // Client-only component\n})\n```\n\n#### Static Data\n```typescript\n// Serve static content from JSON\n// data/services.json\nexport const services = [\n  {\n    id: 'custom-software',\n    title: 'Custom Software Development',\n    description: '...',\n    icon: '/icons/code.svg'\n  },\n  // ...\n]\n\n// Import in server component\nimport { services } from '@/data/services.json'\n```\n\n#### Caching Strategy\n```typescript\n// API route with cache headers\nexport async function GET() {\n  const posts = await getBlogPosts()\n\n  return Response.json(posts, {\n    headers: {\n      'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400'\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n// Revalidate on-demand\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  // ... create blog post\n  revalidatePath('/blog')\n  return Response.json({ success: true })\n}\n```\n\n### Performance Targets\n- ✅ Lighthouse Score: >90 all categories\n- ✅ First Contentful Paint: <1.5s\n- ✅ Time to Interactive: <3.5s\n- ✅ Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s\n- ✅ Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1\n- ✅ First Input Delay: <100ms\n\n## 10. ICO Data Retention Compliance\n\n### Decision\nImplement automated data retention policy aligned with ICO guidelines\n\n### ICO Requirements\n- Personal data kept no longer than necessary\n- Regular review and deletion of outdated data\n- Clear retention periods communicated to users\n- Right to erasure (GDPR Article 17)\n\n### Implementation\n```sql\n-- Database schema with retention\nCREATE TABLE contact_submissions (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  -- ... contact fields\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  retention_until TIMESTAMP DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '2 years'),\n  -- 2 years is typical for B2B leads\n  deleted_at TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Scheduled cleanup job (run monthly)\nDELETE FROM contact_submissions\nWHERE retention_until < NOW()\n  AND deleted_at IS NULL;\n\n-- Soft delete function for GDPR requests\nCREATE FUNCTION gdpr_delete_submission(submission_id INTEGER)\nRETURNS VOID AS $$\nBEGIN\n  UPDATE contact_submissions\n  SET\n    email = 'deleted@privacy.local',\n    name = 'DELETED',\n    company = NULL,\n    project_details = 'DELETED BY USER REQUEST',\n    deleted_at = NOW()\n  WHERE id = submission_id;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n### Privacy Policy Requirements\n- Clearly state retention period (2 years for leads)\n- Explain purpose of data collection\n- Provide contact for data requests\n- Include cookie policy for Google Analytics\n\n## 11. Search Functionality\n\n### Decision\nPostgreSQL full-text search with tsvector\n\n### Rationale\n- **Built-in**: No external service needed\n- **Fast**: GIN indexes provide excellent performance\n- **Flexible**: Supports ranking, highlighting, phrase matching\n- **Cost-effective**: No additional API costs\n\n### Implementation\n```sql\n-- Create search index\nCREATE INDEX idx_blog_search ON blog_posts USING GIN(search_vector);\nCREATE INDEX idx_case_studies_search ON case_studies USING GIN(\n  to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || challenge || ' ' || solution)\n);\n\n-- Search query\nSELECT\n  id,\n  title,\n  ts_headline('english', content, query) as snippet,\n  ts_rank(search_vector, query) as rank\nFROM blog_posts,\n  to_tsquery('english', 'nextjs & typescript') as query\nWHERE search_vector @@ query\nORDER BY rank DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n### Search API\n```typescript\n// app/api/search/route.ts\nexport async function GET(req: Request) {\n  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url)\n  const q = searchParams.get('q')\n\n  if (!q) {\n    return Response.json({ error: 'Query required' }, { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Search across multiple content types\n  const [blogResults, caseStudyResults] = await Promise.all([\n    searchBlogPosts(q),\n    searchCaseStudies(q)\n  ])\n\n  return Response.json({\n    query: q,\n    results: {\n      blog: blogResults,\n      caseStudies: caseStudyResults\n    },\n    total: blogResults.length + caseStudyResults.length\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## 12. Deployment & DevOps\n\n### Decision\nVercel for hosting, Supabase or Neon for PostgreSQL\n\n### Rationale\n- **Vercel**: First-class Next.js support, automatic deployments, edge functions\n- **Database options**:\n  - **Neon**: Serverless Postgres, generous free tier, branching\n  - **Supabase**: Postgres + additional features, good free tier\n  - **Railway**: Simple deployment, Postgres included\n  - **AWS RDS**: Production-grade but more expensive\n\n### Environment Setup\n```env\n# .env.local (development)\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/byte_bridges\nNEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000\nNEXTAUTH_SECRET=local_dev_secret\nNEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX\n\n# .env.production (Vercel)\nDATABASE_URL=[Neon/Supabase connection string]\nNEXTAUTH_URL=https://bytebridges.com\nNEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generated secret]\nNEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX\nEMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net\nEMAIL_USER=apikey\nEMAIL_PASSWORD=[SendGrid API key]\n```\n\n### CI/CD Pipeline\n- **Git push** → Automatic Vercel deployment\n- **Preview deployments** for pull requests\n- **Production deployment** on merge to main\n- **Database migrations** via manual trigger or Prisma Migrate\n\n## Research Summary\n\nAll technical decisions have been made based on:\n1. **Existing codebase analysis**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, PostgreSQL already in use\n2. **Best practices**: Industry-standard patterns for each technology\n3. **Requirements**: WCAG AA, ICO compliance, Google Analytics, admin auth\n4. **Performance**: Optimization strategies to meet Lighthouse targets\n5. **Cost**: Open-source solutions preferred, Vercel free tier suitable for MVP\n\n**No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remaining** - ready to proceed to Phase 1 (Data Model & Contracts).\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6745,"cache_read_input_tokens":76823,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6745,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUuCdsq6ykxZxxYRESHqn","type":"assistant","uuid":"16c49836-185f-4cac-978f-b8a3ecf88a0e","timestamp":"2025-11-07T21:01:49.176Z"}

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the technical context have been resolved through research and established patterns.\n\n## 1. Framework Selection: Next.js 14 with App Router\n\n### Decision\nUse Next.js 14.1.0 with the App Router (not Pages Router)\n\n### Rationale\n- **Server Components by default**: Better performance, smaller bundle sizes\n- **Streaming SSR**: Improved perceived performance with Suspense\n- **Route handlers**: Clean API routes replacing old API pages\n- **Layout system**: Better code reuse and nested layouts\n- **Metadata API**: Built-in SEO optimization\n- **Already in use**: Project dependencies show Next.js 14.1.0 installed\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n- **Pages Router**: Older, more documented, but missing modern features\n- **Remix**: Great DX but smaller ecosystem, steeper learning curve\n- **Astro**: Excellent for static sites but less suitable for admin panel needs\n- **Pure React + Express**: More control but requires more boilerplate\n\n### Implementation Notes\n```typescript\n// Example App Router structure\napp/\n├── (public)/          // Route group for public pages\n│   ├── layout.tsx     // Public layout\n│   └── page.tsx       // Homepage\n├── (admin)/           // Route group for admin\n│   ├── layout.tsx     // Admin layout with auth\n│   └── dashboard/\n└── api/               // Route handlers\n    └── blog/\n        └── route.ts   // API endpoint\n```\n\n## 2. Authentication: NextAuth v4\n\n### Decision\nUse NextAuth v4 with Credentials provider for admin authentication\n\n### Rationale\n- **Industry standard**: Most popular auth solution for Next.js\n- **Session management**: Built-in JWT or database sessions\n- **Middleware integration**: Easy route protection\n- **Type-safe**: Excellent TypeScript support\n- **Already installed**: Package.json shows next-auth@^4.24.0\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n- **Clerk**: Fully managed but overkill for simple admin auth\n- **Auth0**: Enterprise-grade but unnecessary for this use case\n- **Custom JWT solution**: More control but reinventing the wheel\n- **Supabase Auth**: Good but introduces another service dependency\n\n### Implementation Notes\n```typescript\n// lib/auth/config.ts\nimport NextAuth from \"next-auth\"\nimport CredentialsProvider from \"next-auth/providers/credentials\"\nimport { compare } from \"bcryptjs\"\nimport { query } from \"@/lib/db\"\n\nexport const authOptions = {\n  providers: [\n    CredentialsProvider({\n      credentials: {\n        email: { type: \"email\" },\n        password: { type: \"password\" }\n      },\n      async authorize(credentials) {\n        const user = await query(\n          'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1',\n          [credentials.email]\n        )\n        if (user && await compare(credentials.password, user.password_hash)) {\n          return { id: user.id, email: user.email }\n        }\n        return null\n      }\n    })\n  ],\n  session: { strategy: \"jwt\" },\n  pages: {\n    signIn: \"/signin\",\n    error: \"/auth/error\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Security Considerations\n- Password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor: 12)\n- HTTPS only in production\n- CSRF protection via NextAuth\n- Rate limiting on signin endpoint\n- Session timeout: 7 days\n\n## 3. Database: PostgreSQL with pg Driver\n\n### Decision\nPostgreSQL 14+ with node-postgres (pg) client library\n\n### Rationale\n- **Relational model**: Blog posts, case studies have clear relationships\n- **Full-text search**: Built-in `tsvector` for content search\n- **JSON support**: Flexible for tags, metadata\n- **ACID compliance**: Data integrity for content management\n- **Already configured**: db.ts exists, package.json has pg@^8.11.3\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n- **Prisma ORM**: Better DX but adds complexity, migration overhead\n- **Drizzle ORM**: Lightweight but less mature ecosystem\n- **MongoDB**: Good for flexibility but overkill for structured content\n- **SQLite**: Simple but lacks full-text search, not production-ready\n\n### Schema Design Principles\n```sql\n-- Normalized structure\n-- Use SERIAL or UUID for IDs\n-- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at (UTC)\n-- Soft deletes: deleted_at (nullable)\n-- Indexes on foreign keys and search fields\n-- Text search indexes for content\n\nCREATE TABLE blog_posts (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,\n  content TEXT NOT NULL,\n  author_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),\n  category VARCHAR(100),\n  tags TEXT[],\n  published BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,\n  published_at TIMESTAMP,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  search_vector tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (\n    to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content)\n  ) STORED\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_blog_posts_search ON blog_posts USING GIN(search_vector);\nCREATE INDEX idx_blog_posts_published ON blog_posts(published, published_at DESC);\n```\n\n### Connection Pooling\n```typescript\n// lib/db.ts\nimport { Pool } from 'pg'\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\n  max: 20,                 // Maximum pool size\n  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // Close idle connections after 30s\n  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000\n})\n\nexport async function query(text: string, params?: any[]) {\n  const start = Date.now()\n  const res = await pool.query(text, params)\n  const duration = Date.now() - start\n  console.log('Executed query', { text, duration, rows: res.rowCount })\n  return res.rows\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Styling: TailwindCSS with WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance\n\n### Decision\nTailwindCSS 3.4+ with custom accessibility-focused configuration\n\n### Rationale\n- **Utility-first**: Rapid development, consistent spacing/colors\n- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first breakpoints out of the box\n- **Accessibility**: Built-in focus rings, screen reader utilities\n- **Performance**: Purges unused styles in production\n- **Already integrated**: tailwind.config.ts exists\n\n### WCAG 2.1 Level AA Requirements\n```typescript\n// tailwind.config.ts\nexport default {\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        // All color combinations must meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio\n        primary: {\n          50: '#f0f9ff',\n          100: '#e0f2fe',\n          200: '#bae6fd',\n          // ... ensure AA contrast\n          600: '#0284c7', // Primary CTA - 4.52:1 on white\n          700: '#0369a1',\n          900: '#0c4a6e'\n        }\n      },\n      fontSize: {\n        // Minimum 16px for body text\n        base: ['16px', { lineHeight: '1.5' }],\n        lg: ['18px', { lineHeight: '1.6' }],\n        // Heading scale with proper contrast\n      },\n      spacing: {\n        // Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n        'touch': '44px'\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),        // Accessible form styles\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),   // Prose content styling\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Accessibility Checklist\n- ✅ Color contrast 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text\n- ✅ Focus indicators visible (outline-2 outline-offset-2)\n- ✅ Touch targets 44x44px minimum\n- ✅ Semantic HTML (headings, landmarks, lists)\n- ✅ ARIA labels where needed\n- ✅ Keyboard navigation support\n- ✅ Screen reader testing with VoiceOver/NVDA\n\n### Animation Guidelines\n```typescript\n// Respect prefers-reduced-motion\n// framer-motion config\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\n\nconst variants = {\n  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  visible: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 0.4,\n      ease: 'easeOut'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Use motion.div with variants\n<motion.div\n  variants={variants}\n  initial=\"hidden\"\n  animate=\"visible\"\n  // Respects prefers-reduced-motion automatically\n/>\n```\n\n## 5. Forms: React Hook Form + Zod Validation\n\n### Decision\nReact Hook Form 7+ with Zod schema validation\n\n### Rationale\n- **Type safety**: Zod schemas generate TypeScript types\n- **Performance**: Uncontrolled inputs, minimal re-renders\n- **Validation**: Client-side + server-side with same schemas\n- **Multi-step forms**: Built-in support for complex flows\n- **Already installed**: Both libraries in package.json\n\n### Multi-Step Contact Form Pattern\n```typescript\n// lib/validation.ts\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nexport const contactFormSchema = z.object({\n  // Step 1: Basic Info\n  name: z.string().min(2, \"Name required\"),\n  email: z.string().email(\"Valid email required\"),\n  company: z.string().optional(),\n\n  // Step 2: Project Details\n  serviceInterest: z.enum([\n    'custom-software',\n    'web-development',\n    'mobile-apps',\n    'cloud-solutions',\n    'ai-integration',\n    'consulting'\n  ]),\n  budgetRange: z.enum(['<50k', '50k-100k', '100k-250k', '250k+']),\n  timeline: z.enum(['urgent', '1-3-months', '3-6-months', '6+ months']),\n\n  // Step 3: Message\n  projectDetails: z.string().min(50, \"Please provide more details\"),\n\n  // Privacy\n  gdprConsent: z.boolean().refine(val => val === true, {\n    message: \"You must accept the privacy policy\"\n  })\n})\n\nexport type ContactFormData = z.infer<typeof contactFormSchema>\n```\n\n### Server-Side Validation\n```typescript\n// app/api/contact/route.ts\nimport { contactFormSchema } from '@/lib/validation'\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const body = await req.json()\n\n  // Validate with Zod\n  const result = contactFormSchema.safeParse(body)\n\n  if (!result.success) {\n    return Response.json({\n      error: 'Validation failed',\n      details: result.error.flatten()\n    }, { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Process valid data\n  const data = result.data\n  // ... save to database, send email\n}\n```\n\n## 6. Testing Strategy: Playwright E2E + Visual Regression\n\n### Decision\nPlaywright for end-to-end and visual regression testing\n\n### Rationale\n- **Cross-browser**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit support\n- **Accessibility testing**: Built-in ARIA/role assertions\n- **Visual regression**: Screenshot comparison\n- **Fast execution**: Parallel test runner\n- **Already configured**: playwright.config.ts exists\n\n### Test Pyramid\n```\n         /\\\n        /  \\       E2E Tests (Playwright)\n       /____\\      - Critical user flows\n      /      \\     - Cross-browser compatibility\n     /        \\\n    /__________\\   Visual Regression (Playwright)\n   /            \\  - Component snapshots\n  /              \\ - Layout consistency\n /________________\\\nIntegration Tests     Unit Tests\n- API endpoints       - Utility functions\n- Database ops        - Validation schemas\n- Email sending       - Pure logic\n```\n\n### Critical Test Scenarios\n```typescript\n// tests/e2e/contact.spec.ts\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'\n\ntest.describe('Contact Form', () => {\n  test('should complete multi-step form submission', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/contact')\n\n    // Step 1: Basic Info\n    await page.fill('input[name=\"name\"]', 'John Doe')\n    await page.fill('input[name=\"email\"]', 'john@example.com')\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Next\")')\n\n    // Step 2: Project Details\n    await page.selectOption('select[name=\"serviceInterest\"]', 'web-development')\n    await page.selectOption('select[name=\"budgetRange\"]', '50k-100k')\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Next\")')\n\n    // Step 3: Message\n    await page.fill('textarea[name=\"projectDetails\"]', 'Need a new website...')\n    await page.check('input[name=\"gdprConsent\"]')\n\n    // Submit\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Submit\")')\n\n    // Verify success\n    await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toBeVisible()\n    await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toContainText(\n      'We will contact you within 24 hours'\n    )\n  })\n\n  test('should validate required fields', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/contact')\n    await page.click('button:has-text(\"Next\")')\n\n    // Check validation errors\n    await expect(page.locator('text=Name required')).toBeVisible()\n    await expect(page.locator('text=Valid email required')).toBeVisible()\n  })\n\n  test('should be accessible', async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('/contact')\n\n    // Check ARIA labels\n    await expect(page.locator('form')).toHaveAttribute('aria-label')\n\n    // Check keyboard navigation\n    await page.keyboard.press('Tab')\n    const focused = page.locator(':focus')\n    await expect(focused).toHaveAttribute('name', 'name')\n\n    // Check focus indicators\n    const outline = await focused.evaluate(el =>\n      window.getComputedStyle(el).outlineWidth\n    )\n    expect(parseInt(outline)).toBeGreaterThan(0)\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### Visual Regression Setup\n```typescript\n// tests/visual/visual-regression.spec.ts\ntest('Homepage visual consistency', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/')\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')\n\n  // Full page screenshot\n  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('homepage.png', {\n    fullPage: true,\n    animations: 'disabled'\n  })\n\n  // Component screenshot\n  const hero = page.locator('.hero-section')\n  await expect(hero).toHaveScreenshot('hero-section.png')\n})\n```\n\n## 7. Google Analytics Integration (GDPR Compliant)\n\n### Decision\nGoogle Analytics 4 with consent management and cookie banner\n\n### Rationale\n- **Industry standard**: Most widely used analytics platform\n- **GDPR compliance**: Can be configured for ICO requirements\n- **Event tracking**: Custom events for conversions\n- **Next.js integration**: Use next/script for optimal loading\n- **Requirement**: Specified in FR-014\n\n### Implementation Pattern\n```typescript\n// components/GoogleAnalytics.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport function GoogleAnalytics({ measurementId }: { measurementId: string }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Check consent before initializing\n    const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')\n    if (consent === 'accepted') {\n      // @ts-ignore\n      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []\n      function gtag(...args: any[]) {\n        // @ts-ignore\n        window.dataLayer.push(arguments)\n      }\n      gtag('js', new Date())\n      gtag('config', measurementId, {\n        anonymize_ip: true,  // GDPR requirement\n        cookie_flags: 'SameSite=None;Secure'\n      })\n    }\n  }, [measurementId])\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${measurementId}`}\n        strategy=\"afterInteractive\"\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Consent Management\n```typescript\n// components/CookieBanner.tsx\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport function CookieBanner() {\n  const [showBanner, setShowBanner] = useState(false)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')\n    if (!consent) setShowBanner(true)\n  }, [])\n\n  const acceptCookies = () => {\n    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'accepted')\n    setShowBanner(false)\n    window.location.reload() // Reload to initialize GA\n  }\n\n  const declineCookies = () => {\n    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'declined')\n    setShowBanner(false)\n  }\n\n  if (!showBanner) return null\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-gray-900 text-white p-4 z-50\">\n      <div className=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto flex items-center justify-between\">\n        <p>\n          We use cookies to improve your experience and analyze site traffic.\n          <a href=\"/privacy\" className=\"underline ml-2\">Learn more</a>\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"flex gap-4\">\n          <button onClick={declineCookies} className=\"px-4 py-2\">\n            Decline\n          </button>\n          <button\n            onClick={acceptCookies}\n            className=\"px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 rounded\"\n          >\n            Accept\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Event Tracking\n```typescript\n// lib/analytics.ts\nexport function trackEvent(action: string, category: string, label?: string, value?: number) {\n  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {\n    window.gtag('event', action, {\n      event_category: category,\n      event_label: label,\n      value: value\n    })\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage in components\ntrackEvent('contact_form_submit', 'engagement', 'header_cta')\ntrackEvent('case_study_view', 'content', 'healthcare-platform', 1)\n```\n\n## 8. Email Service: Nodemailer with SMTP\n\n### Decision\nNodemailer with configurable SMTP (supports Gmail, SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)\n\n### Rationale\n- **Flexible**: Works with any SMTP provider\n- **Template support**: Can use HTML templates\n- **Attachments**: Support for file attachments (future)\n- **Already installed**: nodemailer@^6.9.0 in package.json\n- **Requirement**: FR-006 specifies email notifications\n\n### Configuration\n```typescript\n// lib/email.ts\nimport nodemailer from 'nodemailer'\n\nconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({\n  host: process.env.EMAIL_HOST,       // smtp.gmail.com\n  port: parseInt(process.env.EMAIL_PORT || '587'),\n  secure: false,                      // true for 465, false for other ports\n  auth: {\n    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,\n    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD  // App password for Gmail\n  }\n})\n\nexport async function sendContactNotification(data: ContactFormData) {\n  const html = `\n    <h2>New Contact Form Submission</h2>\n    <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${data.name}</p>\n    <p><strong>Email:</strong> ${data.email}</p>\n    <p><strong>Company:</strong> ${data.company || 'N/A'}</p>\n    <p><strong>Service Interest:</strong> ${data.serviceInterest}</p>\n    <p><strong>Budget Range:</strong> ${data.budgetRange}</p>\n    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> ${data.timeline}</p>\n    <h3>Project Details:</h3>\n    <p>${data.projectDetails}</p>\n  `\n\n  await transporter.sendMail({\n    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,\n    to: process.env.CONTACT_EMAIL,    // Single admin email (FR-006)\n    subject: `New Contact: ${data.serviceInterest} - ${data.company || data.name}`,\n    html\n  })\n}\n\nexport async function sendConfirmationEmail(to: string, name: string) {\n  await transporter.sendMail({\n    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,\n    to,\n    subject: 'Thank you for contacting Byte Bridges',\n    html: `\n      <h2>Hi ${name},</h2>\n      <p>Thank you for your interest in Byte Bridges. We have received your inquiry and will respond within 24 hours.</p>\n      <p>Best regards,<br/>The Byte Bridges Team</p>\n    `\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n```env\n# .env.local\nEMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com\nEMAIL_PORT=587\nEMAIL_USER=notifications@bytebridges.com\nEMAIL_PASSWORD=app_specific_password\nEMAIL_FROM=Byte Bridges <noreply@bytebridges.com>\nCONTACT_EMAIL=info@bytebridges.com\n```\n\n## 9. Performance Optimization\n\n### Decision\nImplement comprehensive performance optimization strategy\n\n### Key Techniques\n\n#### Image Optimization\n```typescript\n// Use Next.js Image component\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n<Image\n  src=\"/images/hero.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Byte Bridges team\"\n  width={1200}\n  height={600}\n  priority  // For above-the-fold images\n  placeholder=\"blur\"\n  blurDataURL=\"data:image/...\"\n/>\n```\n\n#### Code Splitting\n```typescript\n// Dynamic imports for heavy components\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst AdminDashboard = dynamic(() => import('@/components/admin/Dashboard'), {\n  loading: () => <LoadingSpinner />,\n  ssr: false  // Client-only component\n})\n```\n\n#### Static Data\n```typescript\n// Serve static content from JSON\n// data/services.json\nexport const services = [\n  {\n    id: 'custom-software',\n    title: 'Custom Software Development',\n    description: '...',\n    icon: '/icons/code.svg'\n  },\n  // ...\n]\n\n// Import in server component\nimport { services } from '@/data/services.json'\n```\n\n#### Caching Strategy\n```typescript\n// API route with cache headers\nexport async function GET() {\n  const posts = await getBlogPosts()\n\n  return Response.json(posts, {\n    headers: {\n      'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400'\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n// Revalidate on-demand\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  // ... create blog post\n  revalidatePath('/blog')\n  return Response.json({ success: true })\n}\n```\n\n### Performance Targets\n- ✅ Lighthouse Score: >90 all categories\n- ✅ First Contentful Paint: <1.5s\n- ✅ Time to Interactive: <3.5s\n- ✅ Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s\n- ✅ Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1\n- ✅ First Input Delay: <100ms\n\n## 10. ICO Data Retention Compliance\n\n### Decision\nImplement automated data retention policy aligned with ICO guidelines\n\n### ICO Requirements\n- Personal data kept no longer than necessary\n- Regular review and deletion of outdated data\n- Clear retention periods communicated to users\n- Right to erasure (GDPR Article 17)\n\n### Implementation\n```sql\n-- Database schema with retention\nCREATE TABLE contact_submissions (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  -- ... contact fields\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  retention_until TIMESTAMP DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '2 years'),\n  -- 2 years is typical for B2B leads\n  deleted_at TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Scheduled cleanup job (run monthly)\nDELETE FROM contact_submissions\nWHERE retention_until < NOW()\n  AND deleted_at IS NULL;\n\n-- Soft delete function for GDPR requests\nCREATE FUNCTION gdpr_delete_submission(submission_id INTEGER)\nRETURNS VOID AS $$\nBEGIN\n  UPDATE contact_submissions\n  SET\n    email = 'deleted@privacy.local',\n    name = 'DELETED',\n    company = NULL,\n    project_details = 'DELETED BY USER REQUEST',\n    deleted_at = NOW()\n  WHERE id = submission_id;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\n### Privacy Policy Requirements\n- Clearly state retention period (2 years for leads)\n- Explain purpose of data collection\n- Provide contact for data requests\n- Include cookie policy for Google Analytics\n\n## 11. Search Functionality\n\n### Decision\nPostgreSQL full-text search with tsvector\n\n### Rationale\n- **Built-in**: No external service needed\n- **Fast**: GIN indexes provide excellent performance\n- **Flexible**: Supports ranking, highlighting, phrase matching\n- **Cost-effective**: No additional API costs\n\n### Implementation\n```sql\n-- Create search index\nCREATE INDEX idx_blog_search ON blog_posts USING GIN(search_vector);\nCREATE INDEX idx_case_studies_search ON case_studies USING GIN(\n  to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || challenge || ' ' || solution)\n);\n\n-- Search query\nSELECT\n  id,\n  title,\n  ts_headline('english', content, query) as snippet,\n  ts_rank(search_vector, query) as rank\nFROM blog_posts,\n  to_tsquery('english', 'nextjs & typescript') as query\nWHERE search_vector @@ query\nORDER BY rank DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n### Search API\n```typescript\n// app/api/search/route.ts\nexport async function GET(req: Request) {\n  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url)\n  const q = searchParams.get('q')\n\n  if (!q) {\n    return Response.json({ error: 'Query required' }, { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Search across multiple content types\n  const [blogResults, caseStudyResults] = await Promise.all([\n    searchBlogPosts(q),\n    searchCaseStudies(q)\n  ])\n\n  return Response.json({\n    query: q,\n    results: {\n      blog: blogResults,\n      caseStudies: caseStudyResults\n    },\n    total: blogResults.length + caseStudyResults.length\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## 12. Deployment & DevOps\n\n### Decision\nVercel for hosting, Supabase or Neon for PostgreSQL\n\n### Rationale\n- **Vercel**: First-class Next.js support, automatic deployments, edge functions\n- **Database options**:\n  - **Neon**: Serverless Postgres, generous free tier, branching\n  - **Supabase**: Postgres + additional features, good free tier\n  - **Railway**: Simple deployment, Postgres included\n  - **AWS RDS**: Production-grade but more expensive\n\n### Environment Setup\n```env\n# .env.local (development)\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/byte_bridges\nNEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000\nNEXTAUTH_SECRET=local_dev_secret\nNEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX\n\n# .env.production (Vercel)\nDATABASE_URL=[Neon/Supabase connection string]\nNEXTAUTH_URL=https://bytebridges.com\nNEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generated secret]\nNEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX\nEMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net\nEMAIL_USER=apikey\nEMAIL_PASSWORD=[SendGrid API key]\n```\n\n### CI/CD Pipeline\n- **Git push** → Automatic Vercel deployment\n- **Preview deployments** for pull requests\n- **Production deployment** on merge to main\n- **Database migrations** via manual trigger or Prisma Migrate\n\n## Research Summary\n\nAll technical decisions have been made based on:\n1. **Existing codebase analysis**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, PostgreSQL already in use\n2. **Best practices**: Industry-standard patterns for each technology\n3. **Requirements**: WCAG AA, ICO compliance, Google Analytics, admin auth\n4. **Performance**: Optimization strategies to meet Lighthouse targets\n5. **Cost**: Open-source solutions preferred, Vercel free tier suitable for MVP\n\n**No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remaining** - ready to proceed to Phase 1 (Data Model & Contracts).\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

search functions, etc.\n```\n\n## Data Access Patterns\n\n### Efficient Queries\n\n**Homepage Data Loading**:\n```typescript\n// Single query to load homepage data\nconst homepageData = await Promise.all([\n  query('SELECT * FROM blog_posts WHERE published = true ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 3'),\n  query('SELECT * FROM case_studies WHERE published = true ORDER BY display_order, published_at DESC LIMIT 6'),\n  query('SELECT * FROM testimonials WHERE featured = true ORDER BY display_order LIMIT 6'),\n  // Services, industries from JSON\n])\n```\n\n**Blog List with Pagination**:\n```typescript\nconst limit = 10\nconst offset = (page - 1) * limit\n\nconst [posts, countResult] = await Promise.all([\n  query(`\n    SELECT id, slug, title, excerpt, author_name, category, tags,\n           featured_image_url, published_at, reading_time_minutes\n    FROM blog_posts\n    WHERE published = true\n    ORDER BY published_at DESC\n    LIMIT $1 OFFSET $2\n  `, [limit, offset]),\n  query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_posts WHERE published = true')\n])\n\nreturn {\n  posts,\n  total: countResult[0].count,\n  page,\n  totalPages: Math.ceil(countResult[0].count / limit)\n}\n```\n\n**Search Across Content**:\n```typescript\nconst searchQuery = to_tsquery('english', queryString)\n\nconst [blogResults, caseStudyResults] = await Promise.all([\n  query(`\n    SELECT id, slug, title, excerpt,\n           ts_rank(search_vector, $1) as rank,\n           ts_headline('english', content, $1) as snippet\n    FROM blog_posts\n    WHERE search_vector @@ $1 AND published = true\n    ORDER BY rank DESC\n    LIMIT 10\n  `, [searchQuery]),\n  query(`\n    SELECT id, slug, title, challenge,\n           ts_rank(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || challenge || ' ' || solution), $1) as rank\n    FROM case_studies\n    WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || challenge || ' ' || solution) @@ $1\n      AND published = true\n    ORDER BY rank DESC\n    LIMIT 10\n  `, [searchQuery])\n])\n```\n\n## Data Integrity Rules\n\n1. **Referential Integrity**:\n   - Foreign keys with ON DELETE SET NULL (preserve content if user deleted)\n   - No cascading deletes (soft delete preferred)\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Unique slugs enforced at database level\n   - Email uniqueness for users\n   - Check constraints for ratings (1-5)\n   - NOT NULL for required fields\n\n3. **Timestamps**:\n   - Always store in UTC\n   - Auto-update `updated_at` via trigger or application code\n   - Immutable `created_at`\n\n4. **Soft Deletes**:\n   - Use `deleted_at` timestamp instead of hard deletes\n   - Queries filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`\n   - GDPR requests anonymize data before soft delete\n\n5. **Data Retention**:\n   - Contact submissions: 2 years (ICO compliance)\n   - Blog posts: Indefinite (can be archived)\n   - User data: Until account deleted + grace period\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n1. **Indexes**:\n   - All foreign keys indexed\n   - Composite indexes for common query patterns\n   - GIN indexes for full-text search\n   - Partial indexes for filtered queries\n\n2. **Denormalization**:\n   - `author_name` in blog_posts (avoid JOIN on every query)\n   - Service/industry data in JSON files (static, read-heavy)\n\n3. **Caching Strategy**:\n   - Static data: Bundled at build time\n   - Blog list: Cache-Control headers (revalidate on publish)\n   - Case studies: Same as blog\n   - Contact submissions: No caching (always fresh)\n\n4. **Query Optimization**:\n   - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for slow queries\n   - Limit SELECT columns to needed fields\n   - Paginate large result sets\n   - Use connection pooling (pg Pool)\n\n## Type Safety\n\nAll database types exported from `types/database.ts`:\n```typescript\nexport type {\n  User,\n  UserProfile,\n  BlogPost,\n  BlogCategory,\n  CaseStudy,\n  IndustryType,\n  ServiceType,\n  ResultsMetric,\n  ContactSubmission,\n

search functions, etc.\n```\n\n## Data Access Patterns\n\n### Efficient Queries\n\n**Homepage Data Loading**:\n```typescript\n// Single query to load homepage data\nconst homepageData = await Promise.all([\n  query('SELECT * FROM blog_posts WHERE published = true ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 3'),\n  query('SELECT * FROM case_studies WHERE published = true ORDER BY display_order, published_at DESC LIMIT 6'),\n  query('SELECT * FROM testimonials WHERE featured = true ORDER BY display_order LIMIT 6'),\n  // Services, industries from JSON\n])\n```\n\n**Blog List with Pagination**:\n```typescript\nconst limit = 10\nconst offset = (page - 1) * limit\n\nconst [posts, countResult] = await Promise.all([\n  query(`\n    SELECT id, slug, title, excerpt, author_name, category, tags,\n           featured_image_url, published_at, reading_time_minutes\n    FROM blog_posts\n    WHERE published = true\n    ORDER BY published_at DESC\n    LIMIT $1 OFFSET $2\n  `, [limit, offset]),\n  query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_posts WHERE published = true')\n])\n\nreturn {\n  posts,\n  total: countResult[0].count,\n  page,\n  totalPages: Math.ceil(countResult[0].count / limit)\n}\n```\n\n**Search Across Content**:\n```typescript\nconst searchQuery = to_tsquery('english', queryString)\n\nconst [blogResults, caseStudyResults] = await Promise.all([\n  query(`\n    SELECT id, slug, title, excerpt,\n           ts_rank(search_vector, $1) as rank,\n           ts_headline('english', content, $1) as snippet\n    FROM blog_posts\n    WHERE search_vector @@ $1 AND published = true\n    ORDER BY rank DESC\n    LIMIT 10\n  `, [searchQuery]),\n  query(`\n    SELECT id, slug, title, challenge,\n           ts_rank(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || challenge || ' ' || solution), $1) as rank\n    FROM case_studies\n    WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || challenge || ' ' || solution) @@ $1\n      AND published = true\n    ORDER BY rank DESC\n    LIMIT 10\n  `, [searchQuery])\n])\n```\n\n## Data Integrity Rules\n\n1. **Referential Integrity**:\n   - Foreign keys with ON DELETE SET NULL (preserve content if user deleted)\n   - No cascading deletes (soft delete preferred)\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Unique slugs enforced at database level\n   - Email uniqueness for users\n   - Check constraints for ratings (1-5)\n   - NOT NULL for required fields\n\n3. **Timestamps**:\n   - Always store in UTC\n   - Auto-update `updated_at` via trigger or application code\n   - Immutable `created_at`\n\n4. **Soft Deletes**:\n   - Use `deleted_at` timestamp instead of hard deletes\n   - Queries filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`\n   - GDPR requests anonymize data before soft delete\n\n5. **Data Retention**:\n   - Contact submissions: 2 years (ICO compliance)\n   - Blog posts: Indefinite (can be archived)\n   - User data: Until account deleted + grace period\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n1. **Indexes**:\n   - All foreign keys indexed\n   - Composite indexes for common query patterns\n   - GIN indexes for full-text search\n   - Partial indexes for filtered queries\n\n2. **Denormalization**:\n   - `author_name` in blog_posts (avoid JOIN on every query)\n   - Service/industry data in JSON files (static, read-heavy)\n\n3. **Caching Strategy**:\n   - Static data: Bundled at build time\n   - Blog list: Cache-Control headers (revalidate on publish)\n   - Case studies: Same as blog\n   - Contact submissions: No caching (always fresh)\n\n4. **Query Optimization**:\n   - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for slow queries\n   - Limit SELECT columns to needed fields\n   - Paginate large result sets\n   - Use connection pooling (pg Pool)\n\n## Type Safety\n\nAll database types exported from `types/database.ts`:\n```typescript\nexport type {\n  User,\n  UserProfile,\n  BlogPost,\n  BlogCategory,\n  CaseStudy,\n  IndustryType,\n  ServiceType,\n  ResultsMetric,\n  ContactSubmission,\n  BudgetRange,\n  Timeline,\n  SubmissionStatus,\n  Testimonial,\n  Service,\n  Industry,\n  Technology,\n  TechCategory\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Data Model Complete** - Ready for contract generation (API

Load and analyze the implementation context:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan\n   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints\n   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios\n\n4. **Project Setup Verification**:\n   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:\n\n   **Detection & Creation Logic**:\n   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):\n\n     ```sh\n     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null\n     ```\n\n   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore\n   - Check if .eslintrc*or eslint.config.* exists → create/verify .eslintignore\n   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore\n   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)\n   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore\n   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore\n\n   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only\n   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology\n\n   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):\n   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`\n   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`\n   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`\n   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`\n   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`\n   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`\n   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`\n   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`\n   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`\n   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`\n\n   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:\n   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`\n   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`\n   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`\n   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`\n\n5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:\n   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish\n   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules\n   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]\n   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements\n\n6. Execute implementation following the task plan:\n   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next\n   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  \n   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks\n   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially\n   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding\n\n7. Implementation execution rules:\n   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration\n   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios\n   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints\n   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services\n   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation\n\n8. Progress tracking and error handling:\n   - Report progress after each completed task\n   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails\n   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones\n   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging\n   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed\n   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.\n\n9. Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"2a0ca262-f044-4a67-bd4f-2f1e4bf8be67","timestamp":"2025-11-07T23:08:45.623Z"}

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: $ARGUMENTS\n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"a62cf9f5-f90b-4375-9e7a-68cda1236044","timestamp":"2025-11-07T23:16:07.233Z"}

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze this conversation to ensure I capture all details accurately:\n\n1. **Initial Setup & Login**: User ran the app, encountered authentication error, successfully logged in, then requested to run the app again.\n\n2. **App Running & Visual Testing Request**: User wanted to test with Playwright and do visual tests. I attempted to run Playwright tests but encountered syntax errors in test files.\n\n3. **Test File Fixes**: \n   - Fixed `documentation-generator.spec.ts` by removing an extra closing brace and unnecessary return statement\n   - Fixed `visual-regression.spec.ts` by moving `test.use()` call to top level (outside describe block) per Playwright requirements\n   - Tests were interrupted by user before completion\n\n4. **Database Access Issue**: User noted the app wasn't accessible from browser due to database connection errors (role \"bytebridge\" doesn't exist). I verified the database exists and restarted the dev server.\n\n5. **Git Status Check**: User asked about git status. I showed the branch `001-byte-bridges-enterprise` with many modified and untracked files. User requested to push to git safely.\n\n6. **Safe Git Push**:\n   - Staged appropriate files (source code, tests, configs, new pages)\n   - Excluded temporary files (logs, test files, .claude/)\n   - Created detailed commit message\n   - Successfully pushed to origin with pull request link\n\n7. **Implementation Status Check**: User asked if we finished the last implementation. I identified that we had made significant progress but haven't completed all spec requirements (missing case studies functionality, blog system, testimonials, etc.).\n\n8. **SpecKit Planning Workflow**:\n   - User wanted to run `/speckit.plan` but was interrupted\n   - I successfully ran `/speckit.plan` and generated:\n     - Complete `plan.md` with technical context and architecture\n     - `research.md` with technology decisions\n     - `data-model.md` with database schema\n     - API contracts (4 OpenAPI files)\n     - `quickstart.md` with agent assignments\n     - Updated `CLAUDE.md` agent context\n\n9. **Clarification Session**: User ran `/speckit.clarify` and I asked 5 questions about:\n   - WCAG compliance level → WCAG 2.1 Level AA\n   - Admin user roles → Single admin role\n   - Contact form email routing → Single configurable admin email\n   - Analytics tracking → Google Analytics\n   - Data retention → Inline with ICO guidelines\n\n10. **Tasks Generation Request**: User wanted to run `/speckit.implement` but was blocked because tasks.md didn't exist. I suggested running `/speckit.tasks` first.\n\n11. **Tasks Generation with Agent Assignment**: User ran `/speckit.tasks` with instruction \"WHILST YOUR DOING that ensure we assign the correct agents for the job\". I generated a comprehensive tasks.md with:\n    - 172 tasks organized by user story\n    - Agent assignments in quickstart.md\n    - MVP scope definition\n    - Parallel execution opportunities\n\n12. **Critical User Feedback**: User said \"dont i have a homepage already?\" - This was a key correction indicating I was creating tasks for already-implemented features.\n\n13. **Audit & Revision**: I audited the existing codebase and discovered:\n    - 85+ pages already exist\n    - 30+ components already built\n    - Homepage, services, industries, case studies, blog, contact, auth all exist\n    - Blog posts and case studies are static (hardcoded), not database-backed\n    - No database tables for blog_posts or case_studies\n    - No CRUD APIs for blog/case study management\n\n14. **Updated Tasks**: User confirmed option \"1\" to mark existing work as complete and focus only on missing features. I updated tasks.md to:\n    - Mark 85%+ of frontend as complete\n    - Focus on 126 remaining tasks\n    - Primary gaps: database schema, CMS for blog/case studies, search, analytics, testing\n\n15. **Summary Request**: User requested a detailed conversation summary.\n\nKey technical patterns:\n- Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript\n- PostgreSQL with pg driver\n- NextAuth for authentication\n- TailwindCSS for styling\n- Playwright for testing\n- Existing static content needs migration to dynamic database-backed content\n\nCritical errors fixed:\n- Playwright test syntax errors (test.use() placement, extra closing braces)\n- Git push organized to exclude temp files\n- Tasks.md completely rewritten to reflect actual implementation state\n\nUser's most important feedback:\n- \"dont i have a homepage already?\" - Led to complete audit and task revision\n- \"ensure we assign the correct agents for the job\" - Added agent assignments\n- \"1\" - Confirmed approach to mark existing work complete\n\nCurrent state:\n- Tasks.md updated with 126 remaining tasks (down from 172)\n- Focus on database schema, CMS, search, analytics, compliance\n- Ready for `/speckit.implement` execution\n\nSummary:\n## 1. Primary Request and Intent\n\nThe user's journey through this conversation involved:\n\n1. **Initial App Testing**: Run the app and perform visual testing with Playwright\n2. **Git Management**: Safely push current work to GitHub after reviewing status\n3. **Implementation Planning**: Use SpecKit workflow to plan the Byte Bridges Enterprise Website implementation\n4. **Clarification**: Resolve specification ambiguities through Q&A session\n5. **Task Generation**: Create detailed implementation tasks with proper agent assignments\n6. **Critical Correction**: Audit existing implementation and revise tasks to only include missing features (not rebuild what already exists)\n7. **Summary Request**: Get detailed conversation summary for context preservation\n\n**Most Critical User Feedback**: \"dont i have a homepage already?\" - This fundamentally changed the task breakdown approach from assuming greenfield to recognizing ~85% completion.\n\n## 2. Key Technical Concepts\n\n- **Next.js 14 App Router**: Server and client components, route groups, API routes\n- **TypeScript 5.3**: Type safety across frontend and backend\n- **PostgreSQL**: Database with full-text search (tsvector), connection pooling\n- **NextAuth v4**: Credentials provider for admin authentication\n- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements\n- **Playwright**: E2E testing and visual regression testing\n- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Form validation with type-safe schemas\n- **Framer Motion**: Animations and transitions\n- **Nodemailer**: Email notifications for contact form\n- **Google Analytics 4**: GDPR-compliant analytics with consent management\n- **ICO Compliance**: Data retention policies for contact submissions\n- **SpecKit Workflow**: /speckit.clarify → /speckit.plan → /speckit.tasks → /speckit.implement\n\n## 3.

Restarted dev server to clear cached connections\n\n**Result**: App successfully running at http://localhost:3000\n\n### Error 3: Git Prerequisites Script Permission Denied\n**Description**: `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh` and other scripts lacked execute permissions\n\n**Fix Applied**: Added execute permissions with `chmod +x` before running scripts\n\n**Pattern**: Applied same fix to `setup-plan.sh` and `update-agent-context.sh`\n\n### Error 4: Tasks.md Missing for /speckit.implement\n**Description**: Running `/speckit.implement` failed because tasks.md didn't exist\n\n**Fix Applied**: Ran `/speckit.tasks` first to generate task breakdown\n\n**User Feedback**: User confirmed this was the correct approach\n\n### Critical Issue 5: Tasks Generated for Already-Implemented Features\n**Description**: Initial tasks.md (172 tasks) assumed greenfield project, but ~85% was already implemented\n\n**User Feedback**: \"dont i have a homepage already?\" - This triggered complete audit\n\n**Fix Applied**:\n1. Audited entire codebase (85+ pages, 30+ components)\n2. Identified actual gaps (database schema, CMS, search, analytics)\n3. Rewrote tasks.md with 126 tasks focused only on missing features\n4. Clearly marked existing work as complete\n\n**User Confirmation**: User selected option \"1\" to proceed with this approach\n\n## 5. Problem Solving\n\n### Successfully Solved:\n\n1. **Test Syntax Issues**: Fixed Playwright test configuration errors to enable test execution\n2. **Database Connection**: Resolved authentication error by verifying correct username and restarting server\n3. **Git Workflow**: Safely pushed changes to GitHub, excluding temporary files and preserving important work\n4. **SpecKit Workflow Execution**: Successfully ran /speckit.clarify → /speckit.plan → /speckit.tasks sequence\n5. **Task Breakdown Accuracy**: Completely revised task list to reflect actual implementation state (85% complete, 126 tasks remaining)\n\n### Ongoing/Future Work:\n\n1. **Database Schema Creation**: Need to create migrations for blog_posts, case_studies, testimonials, contact_submissions tables\n2. **Static to Dynamic Migration**: Blog posts and case studies currently hardcoded, need database-backed CMS\n3. **Search Implementation**: SearchOverlay exists but not fully functional\n4. **Analytics Integration**: Google Analytics not yet implemented\n5. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Unknown compliance level, needs audit\n6. **Testing Coverage**: Playwright configured but minimal tests written\n\n## 6. All User Messages\n\n1. \"run the app\"\n2. \"run the app\" (after login)\n3. \"test with playwright do a visual test\"\n4. \"[Request interrupted by user]the app is not accesible from my browser\"\n5. \"whee are we in regards to git\"\n6. \"lets push to git if not already and do it safely\"\n7. \"did we finish our last implementation?\"\n8. \"[Request interrupted by user]\" (during /speckit.plan)\n9. \"B\" (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)\n10. \"A\" (Single admin role)\n11. \"B\" (Single configurable admin email)\n12. \"SHORT GOOGLE ANALYTICS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED\"\n13. \"SHORT INLINE WITH ICO\"\n14. \"[Request interrupted by user]we will need to run this\" (for /speckit.implement)\n15. \"[Request interrupted by user]\" (during /speckit.plan execution)\n16. \"WHILST YOUR DOING that ensure we assign the correct agents for the job\"\n17. \"dont i have a homepage already?\"\n18. \"1\" (Confirmation to mark existing work complete and focus on gaps)\n19. [Summary request]\n\n## 7. Pending Tasks\n\nBased on the final tasks.md:\n\n**Immediate Next Tasks (P1 - Critical)**:\n1. Create database migrations (T001-T005):\n   - 001_blog_posts.sql\n   - 002_case_studies.sql\n   - 003_testimonials.sql\n   - 004_contact_submissions.sql\n2. Create TypeScript types (T034-T038):\n   - src/types/database.ts\n   - src/types/api.ts\n   - src/types/entities.ts\n   - src/lib/validation.ts with Zod schemas\n3. Implement Blog CMS (T006-T019):\n   - API routes for CRUD operations\n   - Admin pages for blog management\n   - Migrate static blog data to database\n4. Implement Case Study CMS (T020-T033):\n   - API routes for CRUD operations\n   - Admin pages for case study management\n   - Migrate static case study data to database\n\n**No explicit pending request from user** - User requested summary, which is being provided now.\n\n## 8. Current Work\n\n**Immediately Before Summary Request**:\n\nI had just completed updating `tasks.md` to reflect the actual implementation state after discovering that ~85% of the frontend was already implemented. \n\n**Context**: User said \"dont i have a homepage already?\" which prompted me to:\n1. Audit the existing codebase\n2. Discover 85+ pages, 30+ components already exist\n3. Identify the actual gaps (database schema, CMS for blog/case studies, search, analytics)\n4. Completely rewrite tasks.md from 172 tasks to 126 tasks\n5. Mark all existing work as complete\n\n**File Modified**: `specs/001-byte-bridges-enterprise/tasks.md`\n\n**Key Changes**:\n- Added \"✅ Already Completed\" section documenting 85+ pages, 30+ components\n- Reorganized \"❌ Missing Features\" to focus on actual gaps\n- Reduced task count from 172 to 126\n- Prioritized: P1 (38 tasks - database/CMS), P2 (27 tasks - search/contact), P3 (43 tasks - analytics/testing), P4 (18 tasks - polish)\n\n**Status**: Tasks.md update complete. User confirmed this approach with \"1\".\n\n## 9. Optional Next Step\n\n**Direct Quote from Most Recent Work**: \nFrom tasks.md:\n```markdown\n**Ready for implementation** ✅\n\nRun `/speckit.implement` to begin executing these tasks.\n```\n\n**Next Step**: User would likely want to run `/speckit.implement` to begin executing the 126 remaining tasks, starting with Phase 1 (Database Foundation - T001-T005 and T034-T038).\n\nHowever, **NO EXPLICIT REQUEST** has been made by the user to proceed with implementation. The last explicit user action was requesting this summary. I should **wait for user confirmation** before starting implementation to ensure alignment with their priorities.\n\n**Recommended User Confirmation**: \"Should I proceed with `/speckit.implement` to start Phase 1 (Database Foundation)?\" or user may have other priorities to address first..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."},"isVisibleInTranscriptOnly":true,"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"cda08910-29c5-4217-ba2a-02a0dcbe65bc","timestamp":"2025-11-08T13:38:33.551Z"}
